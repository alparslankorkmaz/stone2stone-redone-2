          <li>
            Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe
            it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
        <p>
          We may process your information if you have given us specific
          permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for

        </p>
        <p>
          In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under

          including, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and
            consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
          </li>
          <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
          <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>

          <li>
            For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating
            with next of kin
          </li>
          <li>
            If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is,
            or may be victim of financial abuse
          </li>
          <li>
            If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
            compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and
            the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
            breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
            province
          </li>
          <li>
            If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
            order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
          </li>
          <li>
            If it was produced by an individual in the course of their
            employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent
            with the purposes for which the information was produced
          </li>
          <li>
            If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
            purposes

          set out in our Cookie Notice.
        </p>
        6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
        <p>

          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
          personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such

          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
          uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
          notice.
